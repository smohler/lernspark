# Fake Data!
In order to learn apache spark we need **lots** of data.
To start we can use some local disk example files, and we can certainly will want to do that!
The reason is we should always test on a small set of data before launching a real data pipeline.

# Usage
`data` is the very first step in learning spark.
This means it is the *first* thing thing run in this package.
